# Hotel-Management-System-Design
This project developed a basic hotel management system that supports room  booking, restaurant ordering, payment processing, and record management. It validates user  inputs, calculates charges accurately, and tracks payment status. The system provides a simple,  menu-driven interface that facilitates smooth customer and hotel staff interactions.
